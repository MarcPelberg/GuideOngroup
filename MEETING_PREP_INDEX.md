## ⚡ Quick Reference

### Jesse's Core Belief:
> "AI or automation hasn't perfected the human contact that closes some sales and or customer services so there is still a lot we can do through integration of both."

### Your Core Message:
**"AI opens, humans close"** - AI handles 80% of routine questions, humans focus on the 20% requiring judgment, empathy, and expertise.

### Your Goal:
Understand their business → Show how AI enhances it → Propose low-risk pilot

### Remember:
- ✅ Listen first (their business dev person explains their model)
- ✅ Show the demo as proof of concept
- ✅ Focus on value, not pricing
- ✅ You're creating products GuideOn can sell to THEIR clients
- ❌ Don't lead with pricing
- ❌ Don't pitch all 8 use cases - let them tell you what resonates

## 🎯 The Close

**If interested:** "Want to pick one use case and run a 30-day pilot?"
