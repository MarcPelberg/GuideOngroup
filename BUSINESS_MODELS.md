# Potential Business Models - Ideas to Explore

**Purpose:** These are conversation starters, not proposals. Use them to understand what GuideOn is looking for and what makes sense for their business.

---

## Model 1: White-Label Revenue Share

**How it works:**
- We build the AI tools
- GuideOn sells them to their clients as "GuideOn's AI-Enhanced HR Services"
- GuideOn pays us a monthly fee per client using the tools
- GuideOn keeps the margin

**Why this might work:**
- GuideOn increases revenue per client without increasing headcount
- Recurring revenue for both of us
- We handle tech, they handle client relationships
- Scales as they scale

**Questions to ask them:**
- "Do you typically charge clients monthly retainers or project fees?"
- "What kind of margins do you need to make this worth offering?"
- "Would you want to bundle this with existing services or sell it separately?"

---

## Model 2: Pilot Project Approach

**How it works:**
- Pick one specific use case (e.g., employee support chatbot for one of their clients)
- Fixed fee for 30-day pilot
- Includes development, implementation, and support
- Measure results, then decide next steps

**Why this might work:**
- Low risk way to prove value
- They see real results before committing to larger investment
- Learn what works in their specific context
- Can pivot if first use case doesn't land

**Questions to ask them:**
- "Do you have a client who's been asking for better employee support?"
- "What would constitute 'success' in your eyes?"
- "What metrics matter most to your clients?" (time saved, employee satisfaction, cost reduction, etc.)

## Model 3: Build Once, Sell Many

**How it works:**
- Build unified AI platform branded for GuideOn
- One-time development fee + ongoing maintenance
- GuideOn owns the product and sells it to all their clients
- We provide updates and technical support

**Why this might work:**
- GuideOn owns the IP and product
- Full control over how they position and price it
- We get paid for development + recurring maintenance
- Their product, our tech backbone

**Questions to ask them:**
- "Are you looking to own the technology or just license it?"
- "Do you have development budget allocated for new products?"
- "How important is having your own proprietary tools vs. partnering?"

---

## Model 4: Hybrid Consulting + Tech

**How it works:**
- We're not just building tools, we're helping them figure out AI strategy
- Ongoing advisory relationship + tech implementation
- Help them identify opportunities, build solutions, measure results, iterate
- Think "fractional CTO/AI consultant" + development team

**Why this might work:**
- They're exploring AI but might not know exactly what they need yet
- Ongoing relationship vs. one-time project
- We become their "AI team" without them hiring full-time
- Flexible as their needs evolve

**Questions to ask them:**
- "Do you have internal tech/product people, or do you outsource development?"
- "Are you looking for one specific tool or ongoing AI innovation?"
- "What's your appetite for experimentation vs. proven solutions?"

---

## Model 5: Revenue Share Based on Results

**How it works:**
- We build tools for free or low upfront cost
- Get paid based on value created (e.g., % of revenue from AI-enhanced services)
- Higher risk, higher reward for both parties
- Aligns incentives - we only succeed if they succeed

**Why this might work:**
- Removes financial risk for GuideOn
- Shows confidence in our solution
- We're invested in their success, not just delivering software
- Could lead to much higher returns if it works

**Questions to ask them:**
- "Would you be open to performance-based pricing?"
- "What metrics could we tie compensation to?" (client retention, new sales, cost savings, etc.)
- "Are you comfortable with this kind of partnership structure?"

---

## Things to Listen For in the Meeting

Instead of pitching a specific model, listen for signals:

**If they say things like:**
- "We need to control our own technology" → Model 3 (Build once, they own it)
- "We want to test this with one client first" → Model 2 (Pilot project)
- "We don't have much budget right now" → Model 5 (Revenue share)
- "We're looking for a long-term partner" → Model 4 (Hybrid consulting)
- "How do we monetize this?" → Model 1 (White-label revenue share)

**If they ask:**
- "How much does this cost?" → Deflect to: "Depends on what you're trying to accomplish. Tell me more about your goals."
- "What do other clients pay?" → "Every situation is different. What matters is the ROI for your business."
- "Can you give me a ballpark?" → "I could, but I'd rather understand your needs first so I don't throw out a number that doesn't fit."

---

## The Real Question to Answer

**Not:** "How much will this cost?"

**But:** "How will this make or save GuideOn money?"

Focus on:
- Revenue they can generate from AI-enhanced services
- Costs they can avoid (hiring, overtime, missed opportunities)
- Competitive advantage (winning deals they'd otherwise lose)
- Client retention (more value = harder to leave)

Once they see the value, the investment becomes easier to justify.

## Strategy for the Meeting

1. **Don't bring up pricing unless they ask**
2. **If they ask, answer with questions:**
   - "What's your typical budget for new service offerings?"
   - "What would this need to return to be worth the investment?"
   - "Are you looking for a one-time project or ongoing partnership?"
3. **Frame it as exploration:** "There are a few ways we could structure this. Let's figure out what makes sense for your business model."
4. **Propose pilot as low-risk first step:** Easy to say yes to, proves value before bigger commitment

## What NOT to Do

- ❌ Lead with pricing
- ❌ Give a number without understanding their situation
- ❌ Make them feel like you're trying to extract maximum dollars
- ❌ Present pricing as "take it or leave it"

## What TO Do

- ✅ Understand their business model first
- ✅ Let them tell you what success looks like
- ✅ Position yourself as a partner exploring possibilities
- ✅ Focus on value created, not cost incurred
- ✅ Make it easy to say "yes" to a small first step

---

**Remember:** The goal of this meeting isn't to close a deal. It's to understand if there's a fit and what that fit looks like.

You can figure out pricing once you know:
- What they actually need
- What their budget/margins look like
- What the value is worth to them
- What kind of partnership they're looking for
