## Demo Script

**Opening:**
"Jesse, I built something I think you'll find interesting. This is a working demo of what GuideOn's virtual assistant could look like."

[Show the chatbot]

**Try these live:**
1. Type: "I need a freight quote"
   - Watch it collect origin, destination, cargo details
   - See how it captures contact info

2. Type: "What's your on-time delivery rate?"
   - Shows it knows GuideOn's stats (99%)

3. Type: "How do I become an owner-operator?"
   - Demonstrates carrier recruitment use case

**The Pitch:**
"This handles the routine questions 24/7, qualifies leads, and routes hot prospects to your sales team. The bot opens, humans close - exactly what you mentioned about AI + human contact."

**Key talking points:**
1. **Human + AI angle:** "The bot handles the initial conversation, but routes to your sales team the moment someone's ready to commit. AI opens, humans close."
2. **Low-risk pilot:** "We can start with a 30-day trial on one use case - just the quote request bot for MaxTrans. If it works, we expand. If not, no hard feelings."
3. **Direct value tie:** "This directly addresses your 'AI + human contact' interest - the bot qualifies leads so your team can focus on closing deals."

   - *Shows cost savings potential*

## Closing

**If he's interested:**
"Great! I can have this customized and live on your site within 2 weeks. What's the best way to move forward?"

**If he's hesitant:**
"No pressure at all. This is just one example of what we can do. What other challenges are you facing that we might be able to help with?"

## Backup Plan

If the chatbot demo doesn't resonate, pivot to:
- "This is just one example. What specific problems are you trying to solve?"
- "We can build custom tools for your team - what's slowing you down?"
- "What would make the biggest impact on your business right now?"

## Strategic Approach Notes

**Remember:** You're following Option A from the plan:
- Demo is hosted on YOUR domain (not replacing their site)
- Shows capability without being presumptuous
- Say: "I built this as an example of what's possible"

**Avoid:**
- Don't position this as a website replacement
- Don't devalue your work by making it seem "easy"
- Don't do spec work - this is a capability demo

**Focus on:**
- The chatbot solves real problems (after-hours leads, routine questions)
- It's a tool that complements their existing sales process
- Low-risk pilot approach builds trust

---

**Remember:** You're not just selling a chatbot. You're selling:
- Time savings
- Lead capture
- Professional image
- Competitive advantage
- Peace of mind

Good luck! 🚀
