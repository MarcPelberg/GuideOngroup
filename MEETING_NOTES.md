# Meeting Prep - GuideOn Demo (UPDATED)

## CRITICAL CONTEXT - What GuideOn Actually Does

**GuideOn provides HUMAN RESOURCE SERVICES** (not freight/logistics as originally assumed)

**Jesse's exact request:**
> "Explain how your services would help us (my business dev person will explain what we do) and how your services might be able to be an add on to our human resource service. AI or automation hasn't perfected the human contact that closes some sales and or customer services so there is still a lot we can do through integration of both."

**Key insights:**
- They want AI as an **ADD-ON to their HR services** (to offer to their clients)
- Jesse believes in **AI + Human integration** (not replacement)
- Their business dev person will explain their model first
- **YOU ARE NOT SELLING TO GUIDEON - You're creating products GuideOn can sell to THEIR clients**

## What You Built

A **working AI chatbot demo** that demonstrates the "AI opens, humans close" philosophy. This is a proof of concept showing how AI + human integration works in practice.

## Demo URL

Once deployed to Vercel, you'll have a URL like: `guideon-demo.vercel.app`

## Key Features to Highlight (Reframed for HR Context)

1. **24/7 Availability** - AI handles routine questions anytime (employees, candidates, clients)
2. **Intelligent Routing** - AI qualifies and routes complex issues to human experts
3. **Professional Branding** - Can be white-labeled as GuideOn's product
4. **Real-time Streaming** - Smooth, modern chat experience
5. **Mobile Responsive** - Works on any device

## Meeting Flow (REVISED)

### Step 1: LISTEN FIRST (15 minutes)
- Let their business dev person explain GuideOn's HR service model
- Take notes on:
  - What services they provide
  - What their typical client looks like
  - What pain points they're solving
  - Where they're struggling to scale
- Ask clarifying questions

### Step 2: Show the Demo (10 minutes)
"So I built this as a proof of concept for AI + human integration. This specific example is for lead qualification, but the same principle applies to HR services."

**Frame it as:**
"Watch how AI handles initial contact and qualification, then routes to humans when it gets complex. This is the 'AI opens, humans close' model you mentioned."

**Key point:**
"This same approach works for employee support, candidate screening, benefits Q&A - anywhere you want AI handling routine questions so your team focuses on complex HR issues."

### Step 3: Bridge to HR Opportunities (5 minutes)
"I created a document with 6 specific ways AI could enhance your HR service offerings. Want to walk through it?"

[Open AI_OPPORTUNITIES.md]

### Step 4: Collaborative Discussion (20 minutes)
"Based on what you just told me about your services, which of these opportunities would have the biggest impact for you or your clients?"

**Listen for:**
- What excites them
- What pain points they mention
- What their clients are asking for
- Where they're losing deals to competitors

### Step 5: Propose Pilot (5 minutes)
"Want to pick one use case and run a 30-day pilot? Low risk, measurable results, and we can prove the value before scaling."

## Key Talking Points (Reframed for HR Services):

1. **Human + AI Philosophy:** "You're absolutely right that AI hasn't perfected human contact. The goal isn't replacement - it's making your HR team more effective. AI handles the 80% of routine questions, your team focuses on the 20% that requires human judgment, empathy, and expertise."

2. **Add-on Revenue Stream:** "This isn't just about improving your operations - it's about offering AI-enhanced HR services to your clients. You increase your value proposition and margins without proportionally increasing headcount."

3. **Low-Risk Pilot:** "We can start with one use case - maybe employee support chatbot or candidate screening - with one of your clients. 30 days, measure the results, then decide if it's worth scaling."

4. **Competitive Differentiation:** "Most HR providers are either fully manual (expensive, slow) or fully automated (cheap, impersonal). You'd be offering the hybrid model - AI for efficiency, humans for empathy. Best of both worlds."

5. **White-Label Opportunity:** "You sell it as GuideOn's product. We handle the tech, you handle the client relationships and HR expertise. You keep most of the margin."

## Value Props to Mention (HR Services Context)

**For GuideOn's Clients (Companies using their HR services):**
- **24/7 Employee Support:** Employees get instant answers to benefits, PTO, policy questions anytime
- **Faster Hiring:** AI pre-screens candidates, recruiters only interview qualified people
- **Better Onboarding:** New hires get consistent guidance, HR focuses on relationship building
- **Cost Savings:** Handle more employees without adding HR headcount
- **Better Employee Experience:** Instant responses vs. waiting for email replies

**For GuideOn Internally:**
- **Increased Revenue Per Client:** Add $200-600/month per client with AI services
- **Higher Margins:** 70-80% margin on AI add-ons vs. traditional labor-based services
- **Competitive Edge:** "AI-Enhanced HR Services" differentiates from competitors
- **Scalability:** Handle larger clients without proportionally increasing staff
- **Retain Clients:** More value = harder to switch providers

**Quantify the Value:**
- "If your HR team could focus 80% of their time on strategic work instead of answering 'Where's my W-2?' - what's that worth?"
- "What if you could take on 50% more clients without hiring 50% more HR specialists?"
- "If you could charge $500/month more per client and it only costs you $100 - that's $400/month recurring revenue per client"

## Discovery Questions to Ask (HR Services Context)

**About Their Business:**
1. "What services do you provide to your clients?" (payroll, benefits admin, recruiting, compliance, etc.)
2. "What does your typical client look like?" (company size, industry, pain points)
3. "Where are you seeing the most growth opportunities?"
4. "What's your biggest challenge in scaling the business right now?"

**About Pain Points:**
5. "What percentage of your team's time is spent on repetitive questions vs. high-value strategic work?"
6. "Are your clients asking for technology solutions, or is this more about proactive differentiation?"
7. "What makes you lose deals to competitors?"
8. "What would help you take on larger clients without overwhelming your team?"

**About AI Readiness:**
9. "Have you experimented with any automation or AI tools internally?"
10. "What concerns do you have about AI in HR services?" (Listen for: job replacement fears, quality concerns, implementation complexity)

**About Opportunities (After showing AI_OPPORTUNITIES.md):**
11. "Which of these use cases resonates most with problems you're seeing?"
12. "If we could solve one pain point for your clients in the next 30 days, what would have the biggest impact?"

## Business Models to Explore (See BUSINESS_MODELS.md for details)

**DON'T bring up pricing unless they ask.**

If they ask, redirect to value:
- "What would this need to return to be worth the investment?"
- "How do you typically budget for new service offerings?"
- "Are you looking for a one-time project or ongoing partnership?"

**Potential approaches to explore based on their needs:**
- White-label revenue share (they sell to clients, we provide tech)
- Pilot project (prove value with one client first)
- Platform build (they own it, we maintain it)
- Ongoing consulting + development (fractional AI team)
- Performance-based pricing (low upfront, share in results)

**Listen for signals about what they care about:**
- Control/ownership → They might want to own the platform
- Risk reduction → Start with pilot
- Budget constraints → Revenue share or performance-based
- Long-term partnership → Ongoing consulting model

**The goal:** Understand what success looks like to them, then figure out how to structure it.

## Technical Details (If Asked)

- Built with Next.js (modern, fast)
- Uses OpenAI GPT-4o-mini (cost-effective, fast responses)
- Deployed on Vercel (reliable, scales automatically)
- Can integrate with their existing site or stand alone
- Can connect to their CRM/email system for lead routing

## Closing

**If he's interested:**
"Great! I can have this customized and live on your site within 2 weeks. What's the best way to move forward?"

**If he's hesitant:**
"No pressure at all. This is just one example of what we can do. What other challenges are you facing that we might be able to help with?"

## Backup Plan

If the chatbot demo doesn't resonate, pivot to:
- "This is just one example. What specific problems are you trying to solve?"
- "We can build custom tools for your team - what's slowing you down?"
- "What would make the biggest impact on your business right now?"

## Strategic Approach Notes

**Remember:** You're following Option A from the plan:
- Demo is hosted on YOUR domain (not replacing their site)
- Shows capability without being presumptuous
- Say: "I built this as an example of what's possible"

**Avoid:**
- Don't position this as a website replacement
- Don't devalue your work by making it seem "easy"
- Don't do spec work - this is a capability demo

**Focus on:**
- The chatbot solves real problems (after-hours leads, routine questions)
- It's a tool that complements their existing sales process
- Low-risk pilot approach builds trust

---

**Remember:** You're not just selling a chatbot. You're selling:
- Time savings
- Lead capture
- Professional image
- Competitive advantage
- Peace of mind

Good luck! 🚀
